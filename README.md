# Movie-Recommendation-System

The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.

They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.

## There are basically three types of recommender systems:

### 1-Content Based Filtering-
These filtering methods are based on the description of an item and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In a content-based recommendation system, keywords are used to describe the items; besides, a user profile is built to state the type of item this user likes. In other words, the algorithms try to recommend products which are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. The idea of content-based filtering is that if you like an item you will also like a ‘similar’ item. For example, when we are recommending the same kind of item like a movie or song recommendation. This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research.

### 2-Collaborative Filtering- 
This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.

### 3- Demographic Filtering- 
They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.
